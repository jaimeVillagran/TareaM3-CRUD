<h1 align="center">ToDo App</h1>
This is our backend project .v1 for Bootcamp MERN last challenge.

<h2 align="center">Tecnical Descriptions</h2>
We developed a ToDo app, following the requeriments given by Miguel Chamorro, our teacher:

1) Project architecture based on clean Onion architecture and necessary directories for the completion of the challenge with proper organization.
2) Creation of 3 MongoDB database models (Auth, User, Task).
3) Creation of parent and child routes using HTTP and middleware usage.
4) Handling exceptions and request validations using Joi.
5) Global project configurations: nodemon, editor config, eslint, prettier, tsconfig, environment variables, database, and server.
6) Handling traceability through logs.
7) Documentation of REST services.
8) Security through cookies and tokens.
9) SOLID principles, design patterns, and declarative code through abstractions.
10) 1 unit test and 1 integration test related to CRUD operations using Jest.



<h3 align="center">This app contains the next functions:</h3>
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>Create an User with authentication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User Login</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Add a task with a description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete a task</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Update a task</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Get a task</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Get all tasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Get all tasks by date *</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Get all tasks by status *</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p align="right">*Pending for next version.</p>

You can register an user, save your tasks and check when they are completed.

Thank you very much to our beloved teacher, Miguel Chamorro, for his constant dedication to sharing knowledge and for supporting our inquiries. We eagerly look forward to meeting again, not as students, but as colleagues in the workplace.
We will continue developing our skills and striving to apply both the technical and human aspects that we have been learning.
